### Error as a state variable

```js
"use client"
import { useState } from 'react'
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'
import { createClientComponentClient } from "@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs"

// components
import AuthForm from "../AuthForm"

export default function Signup() {
  const router = useRouter()
  const [error, setError] = useState('')

  const handleSubmit = async (e, email, password) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    setError('')

    const supabase = createClientComponentClient()
    const { error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
      email,
      password,
      options: {
        emailRedirectTo: `${location.origin}/api/auth/callback`
      }
    })
    if (error) {
      setError(error.message)
    }
    if (!error) {
      router.push('/verify')
    } 
  }

  return (
    <main>
      <h2 className="text-center">Sign up</h2>

      <AuthForm handleSubmit={handleSubmit} />

      {error && (
        <div className="error">{error}</div>
      )}
    </main>
  )
}
```

In this code, the `error` variable is used to store and update the error message. It is currently declared and managed using the `useState` hook.

If you want to change it to an ordinary variable, you would need to modify the code accordingly. However, keep in mind that by doing so, **you won't be able to trigger a re-render of the component when the error value changes**. 
*This means that any changes to the `error` variable won't be reflected in the UI*.

If you don't need the reactivity and rendering behavior provided by `useState`, you can replace it with a regular variable. Just make sure to update the code that references error accordingly.

Here is why making `error` an ordinary variable is not a good idea:

- It would be more difficult to track changes: If `error` were an ordinary variable, it would be more difficult to track changes to its value. You would need to manually update the variable's value in each place where it is used.

- It would make the code less maintainable: Having a separate state variable for the error message makes the code more maintainable. It is easier to understand and change the code when you can clearly see which variables are being used for different purposes.

- It would be more difficult to test: It would be more difficult to test the code if error were an ordinary variable. You would need to manually set the variable's value in each test case.

Overall, **it is recommended to use state variables for managing data that can change over time**, such as the error message in this case. This will make the code more maintainable, testable, and easier to work with.
