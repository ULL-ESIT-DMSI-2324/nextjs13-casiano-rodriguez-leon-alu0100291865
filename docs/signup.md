### Error as a state variable

```js
"use client"
import { useState } from 'react'
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'
import { createClientComponentClient } from "@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs"

// components
import AuthForm from "../AuthForm"

export default function Signup() {
  const router = useRouter()
  const [error, setError] = useState('')

  const handleSubmit = async (e, email, password) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    setError('')

    const supabase = createClientComponentClient()
    const { error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
      email,
      password,
      options: {
        emailRedirectTo: `${location.origin}/api/auth/callback`
      }
    })
    if (error) {
      setError(error.message)
    }
    if (!error) {
      router.push('/verify')
    } 
  }

  return (
    <main>
      <h2 className="text-center">Sign up</h2>

      <AuthForm handleSubmit={handleSubmit} />

      {error && (
        <div className="error">{error}</div>
      )}
    </main>
  )
}
```

In this code, the `error` variable is used to store and update the error message. It is currently declared and managed using the `useState` hook.

If you want to change it to an ordinary variable, you would need to modify the code accordingly. However, keep in mind that by doing so, **you won't be able to trigger a re-render of the component when the error value changes**. 
*This means that any changes to the `error` variable won't be reflected in the UI*.

If you don't need the reactivity and rendering behavior provided by `useState`, you can replace it with a regular variable. Just make sure to update the code that references error accordingly.

Here is why making `error` an ordinary variable is not a good idea:

- It would be more difficult to track changes: If `error` were an ordinary variable, it would be more difficult to track changes to its value. You would need to manually update the variable's value in each place where it is used.

- It would make the code less maintainable: Having a separate state variable for the error message makes the code more maintainable. It is easier to understand and change the code when you can clearly see which variables are being used for different purposes.

- It would be more difficult to test: It would be more difficult to test the code if error were an ordinary variable. You would need to manually set the variable's value in each test case.

Overall, **it is recommended to use state variables for managing data that can change over time**, such as the error message in this case. This will make the code more maintainable, testable, and easier to work with.

### location

In JavaScript, **location** typically refers to the `window.location` object, which provides information about the current URL of the web page. It contains properties such as `href`, `protocol`, `hostname`, `pathname`, and more.

`location.origin` is a property of the `window.location` object that represents the origin of the current URL. The origin of a URL is a combination of 
- the protocol, 
- hostname, and port number of the website that the URL is pointing to. 

For example, the origin of the URL `https://www.example.com` is `https://www.example.com`.

The `location.origin` property is commonly used in different scenarios, such as:

1. **Redirecting to another website:** When redirecting to another website, you can use `location.origin` to construct the full URL of the destination website.

2. **Making cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) requests:** When making CORS requests from a web page to a different origin, you can use `location.origin` to specify the correct origin header in the request.

3. **Restricting access to certain resources:** You can use `location.origin` to check the origin of the current request and prevent access to certain resources from unauthorized origins.

4. **Handling protocol switching:** When switching between secure (HTTPS) and insecure (HTTP) URLs, you can use `location.origin` to check the current protocol and update the appropriate headers accordingly.

Overall, `location.origin` is a useful property in web JavaScript applications that provides information about the origin of the current URL and can be used for various purposes, including redirection, CORS handling, resource access restriction, and protocol switching.

## Two ifs?

In the Next.js code below for a `signup` page 

```js
"use client"
import { useState } from 'react'
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'
import { createClientComponentClient } from "@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs"

// components
import AuthForm from "../AuthForm"

export default function Signup() {
  const router = useRouter()
  const [error, setError] = useState('')

  const handleSubmit = async (e, email, password) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    setError('')

    const supabase = createClientComponentClient()
    const { error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
      email,
      password,
      options: {
        emailRedirectTo: `${location.origin}/api/auth/callback`
      }
    })
    if (error) {
      setError(error.message)
    }
    if (!error) {
      router.push('/verify')
    } 
  }

  return (
    <main>
      <h2 className="text-center">Sign up</h2>

      <AuthForm handleSubmit={handleSubmit} />

      {error && (
        <div className="error">{error}</div>
      )}
    </main>
  )
}
```

Can I change this two `if`s 

```js
    if (error) {
      setError(error.message)
    }
    if (!error) {
      router.push('/verify')
    } 
```
by an `if ... else ...`construct? 
Or is it due to the async nature of the `error` state variable 
that two `if`s are indeed needed?
