## `next/navigation` and `next/router`

**Next/navigation** was introduced in Next.js 13 and is the newer of the two packages. It provides a more comprehensive and flexible routing solution for Next.js applications. It offers features such as dynamic routes, nested routes, custom routing logic, and more.

**Next/router** is the original routing package for Next.js and is still supported in Next.js 14. It is a simpler and more lightweight package that is suitable for basic routing needs. It does not support all of the features of `next/navigation`.

### Differences

Here is a table summarizing the key differences between `next/navigation` and `next/router`:

| Feature | next/navigation | next/router |
|---|---|---|
| **Complexity** | More complex | Simpler |
| **Features** | More comprehensive routing features | Basic routing features |
| **Dynamic routes** | Supports dynamic routes with named parameters and wildcard parameters | Supports dynamic routes with only named parameters |
| **Nested routes** | Supports nested routes | Supports nested routes |
| **Custom routing logic** | Allows for custom routing logic | Does not allow for custom routing logic |

### Which package should you use?

If you need a simple routing solution for your Next.js application, then `next/router` is a good choice. However, if you need a more comprehensive and flexible routing solution, then `next/navigation` is the better choice.

Here is a recommendation for when to use each package:

* **Use next/router:**
    * If you have basic routing needs and don't need any of the advanced features of next/navigation.
    * If you are migrating from an older version of Next.js that uses next/router.

* **Use next/navigation:**
    * If you need a more comprehensive and flexible routing solution.
    * If you need to use dynamic routes with wildcard parameters.
    * If you need to use nested routes.
    * If you need to implement custom routing logic.
